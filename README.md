This is a project to combine words from a Vector of Vectors list.

The result is to log to the console all combinations of the first vector words with the remaining vectors of the vector.
   Note: each vector can vary in size and length.
   
The function produces strings that contain each possible combination for the Word List passed into it.

The project's file name is "practice.2.js".
